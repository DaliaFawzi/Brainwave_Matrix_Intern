# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
this project is about Natural Language Process (NLP) in machine learning to analyze the sentiment of people for something.
the data is sourced from kaggle 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis' , it is about 2 data set 
one for training set and one for validation and testing.

## üìä Sentiment Analysis using NLP
This project is a Sentiment Analysis using NLP designed to provide the feelings of people towards something using logistic Regression.

üìÅ Data Sources

This project uses two CSV files:

###  `cleaned_twitter_training.csv`
Contains details of:
- **Tweer_ID**
- **Entity**
- **Sentiment**
- **Tweet_Content**

###  `cleaned_twitter_validation.csv`
Contains details of:
- **Tweer_ID**
- **Entity**
- **Sentiment**
- **Tweet_Content**

# First - Cleaning Data for both files
import Required libraries such as 'import numpy as np,import pandas as pd,import seaborn as sns,import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import emoji,import re' 
1- there is no headers in data so when reading file put ' headers = None' then put your headers 
2- check if there is null values and this data has null values in 'Tweet_Cintent column' then handle it ( in this case i drop it as
  the total of null values did not exceed 5% so there is no effect in data)
3- check duplicates in this data there is a duplicated values then drop it 
4- for validation data there are emojis in 'Tweet_Content Column' so we must remove it using emoji library

# Second - Create (NLP) using Machine Learning Model
import Required libraries such as 'from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer # convert each text_cell to number to reflect the interest of words
from sklearn.svm import SVC,from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression,from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score # model accuracy using F1-score'
1- Reading Cleaned Data 
2- using label encoder to encode some data columns such as 'Entity and Sentiments' for both Training and validation data
3- Prepare features'Tweet_Content' and target 'Sentiment'
4- using TF-IDF Vectorization (fit on training, transform both)
5- using logistic regression model to initialize and train the model
6- Predict on validation data
7- Evalution using Accuracy
8- Examples

## üõ† Tools Used
- **Python** for data cleaning and machine learning
